## Installation
### Quick Start
I highly recommend that you set up [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/). I put a lot of care into writing the configuration files to make it easy for you all <3

Rename the **docker-compose.yml.dist** file to **docker-compose.yml** and add modify the file, adding the relavent IDs and API tokens. The environment can be built relatively painlessly using the command **docker-compose up --build** thereafter.
